Ideas on How Technology Can Aid Forest Management:
1. Drones for aerial surveys to monitor tree health and forest conditions.
2. Remote sensing technology for assessing forest cover and biodiversity.
3. IoT sensors for real-time data on soil moisture and weather conditions.
4. Mobile apps for reporting illegal logging and forest fires.
5. Machine learning models to predict forest growth and disease outbreaks.
